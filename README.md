# HandGestureControl

This Python script utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to track hand landmarks through a webcam. It interprets hand gestures to control the computer cursor's movement, enable clicking and double-clicking, perform scrolling, and adjust system volume. The hand's position and gestures are detected in real-time, offering an interactive interface for hands-free computer control.



## MediaPipe

MediaPipe is an open-source library developed by Google that provides a set of pre-trained machine learning models for various computer vision tasks. It simplifies the development of applications involving face detection, hand tracking, pose estimation, and more. MediaPipe is designed to work in real-time, making it valuable for projects requiring robust and efficient visual perception capabilities.







## Features

- Hand Tracking: Utilizes the MediaPipe library to track the landmarks of the user's hand through a webcam.

- Cursor Movement: Maps hand movements to control the computer cursor on the screen.

- Clicking and Double-Clicking: Interprets specific hand gestures to simulate mouse clicks and double-clicks.

- Scrolling: Recognizes hand gestures to trigger scrolling actions, allowing for hands-free scrolling.

- Volume Control: Detects hand gestures for adjusting system volume, providing a hands-free method for volume control.

- Real-time Interaction: Performs all these actions in real-time, creating an interactive and gesture-based interface for hands-free computer control.
